I. Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a CNN-based license plate detection model that can automatically localize license plates in images with high accuracy and efficiency. License plate detection is important in various applications, including traffic management, parking management, toll collection, law enforcement, and surveillance. Manual detection of license plates is a challenging task due to the large number of vehicles on the road and the variability in license plate design and positioning. Manual detection also requires a significant amount of time and resources, which can be a bottleneck in large-scale applications.

II. Methodology

Data collection and preprocessing:

The 433 images with bounding box annotations which is collected on kaggle will be used for training and testing the model. We will preprocessing the dataset by Resize the images, Normalize the pixel values and Extract the license plate region.

Model training:

For the CNN-based license plate detection model, we will use YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN (Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architectures. These two architectures have shown excellent performance in object detection tasks and have been widely used in the literature. We will experiment with both architectures to compare their performance on our dataset.

optimization:

We will optimize the model using a combination of hyperparameter tuning, experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization, to find the best set of parameters that maximize the accuracy and efficiency of the model. 

Evaluation metrics and validation:

We will use a combination of evaluation metrics and validation techniques to assess the performance of the model. The evaluation metrics that we will use include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
